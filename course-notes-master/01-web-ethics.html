        <h2>Rule No. 1</h2>

        <p>Do not steal.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Hot Linking</h2>

        <p>Hot linking is including source material from another server in your code to be hosted elsewhere.</p>

        <p>It costs money to host digital files and transfer those files to users. When you "hot link" a file, you are <del>using</del> <ins>stealing</ins> the hosting resources of another person, business.</p>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Example</h2>

        <p>The image below is coming directly from Wikipedia. <strong>DO NOT</strong> do this.</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Anhingatrailalligator.png/320px-Anhingatrailalligator.png" alt="American Alligator " />

        <h2>Avoid Hot Linking</h2>

        <p>As long as you have permission to use the media, download it and upload it to your own server. Link to the file on your server.</p>

        <p>The image below is in the file structure on our server:</p>

        <img src="img/00-alligator.jpg" alt="American Alligator " />

        <h2>Design/Code Theft</h2>

        <p>It is considered stealing to take a design (or unique elements of a design) and make them your own.</p>

        <p>Usually "pirated" web sites are based on stolen source materials, code.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Don't...</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Use search engines to find images, video</li>
          <li>Sample music from your personal library for video</li>
          <li>Copy text from another source</li>
          <li>Download fonts to create a logo</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>What about...</h2>

        <p><em>"I ran in a marathon and bought images of the moment I crossed the finish line. Can I use these on the web?"</em></p>

        <p><strong>It depends.</strong>

        <p>Unless the photographer sold you the rights to freely use the image in personal or commercial settings, you may not. Just because you purchased the images does not guarantee your rights to use them as you please.</p>

        <p>When in doubt, <strong>ASK</strong>.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>What about...</h2>

        <p><em>"I did work for a business that I'd like to showcase on the web..."</em></p>

        <p>Again, <strong>it depends</strong>.</p>

        <p>You are the creator of the work, but you may have ceeded ownership of the work to your client. As long as the work is not secret or protected by a non-disclosure agreement, you can probably use it.</p>
